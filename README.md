# HEL-Paradox
This is the code, that was used to model the populations of the Canadian Lynx and Snowshoe Hare to investigate the HEL (Hare Eats Lynx) paradox.

The code files are some of the simulations that were performed during this investigation. The motivation for each simulation alongside the conclusion drawns are explained in the paper, that is also uploaded in this repository. The code  predominantly consists of solving an ODE system numerically using the runge-kutta (RK45) method and using an optimisation algorithm to estimate the values of parameters in the ODE system. The code was written in Python 3.11.1.
